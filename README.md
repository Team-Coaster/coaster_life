## Overview
### Description
Social media app that allows coaster enthusiast to track their coaster/ride count and allows allows them to take picutres and meet other people. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social/Travel
- **Mobile:** Camera, location, real time??
- **Story:** Allows our users to track how many different rides they have been on and how many times they rode their favorite ride(s) but also allows them to find new park friends and lets them take pictures for their accounts
- **Market:** The market is pretty niche but has a dedicated community. Coaster enthusiats love to keep a track of their ride count and also talk about their favorite rides. Also with the app they could get their other friends and create a bigger community
- **Habit:** This is not an everyday app, but some people could use it a few times a week, especially those who "live" at theme/amusement parks or those who travel a lot.
- **Scope:** The scope of this project is a little large but I think that it is feasiable to accomplish, especially a stripped down aspect if we just focus on the regional Six Flags park that is "right down the street" for testing purposes.
